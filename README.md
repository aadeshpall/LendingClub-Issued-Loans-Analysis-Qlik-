## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the lending strategy of our financial institution by leveraging comprehensive insights derived from LendingClub loan data. Our current strategy lacks sufficient data-driven insights, leading to challenges in accurate risk identification, predicting loan defaults, and dynamically adjusting lending criteria in response to market conditions.

### Objectives

- **Risk Identification:** Develop robust methods for accurately assessing borrower risk using detailed analysis of LendingClub loan data.
  
- **Default Prediction:** Create predictive models to forecast loan default rates with higher precision.
  
- **Dynamic Lending Criteria:** Implement a dynamic system for adjusting lending criteria based on real-time market data and borrower behavior trends.

## Scope

This project encompasses the following key activities:

- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Aggregate and preprocess LendingClub loan data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct thorough EDA to uncover patterns and insights related to borrower behavior and market dynamics.
  
- **Model Development:** Develop and validate predictive models for risk assessment and default prediction.
  
- **System Integration:** Integrate predictive models into the existing lending system, enabling dynamic adjustments to lending criteria.

## Deliverables

- **Comprehensive Data Report:** Detailed report on data cleaning and preprocessing, including descriptive statistics and data visualization.
  
- **EDA Insights:** A set of insights derived from EDA, highlighting key factors influencing borrower behavior and loan performance.
  
- **Predictive Models:** Trained and validated models for risk identification and default prediction, with documentation on model performance.
  
- **Dynamic Lending System:** An integrated system that utilizes predictive models to adjust lending criteria dynamically, including a user manual and technical documentation.
